## Description

FOR any private individual, business, or other institution/entity WHO would like to provide or receive non-monetary donations, THE FREEcycle is a location-specific web-based social platform THAT allows users to create an account to post their own donations or message the author of other posts to receive items free of charge. UNLIKE other legacy sales-based platforms, OUR product is built to show users posts of items they didn’t know they needed with a robust user network while storing no monetary transactions.
